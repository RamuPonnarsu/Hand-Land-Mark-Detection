Hand landmark detection in Python involves identifying and locating key points or landmarks on a human hand in images or video frames. This task is typically accomplished using computer vision and machine learning techniques. One popular approach is to use pre-trained deep learning models, such as MediaPipe Hands, which provide accurate hand landmark predictions. These models are often implemented using popular libraries like OpenCV and TensorFlow in Python. The process involves capturing or loading an image, passing it through the trained model, and obtaining the coordinates of specific hand landmarks, such as fingertips, joints, and palm center. This information can be utilized in various applications, including gesture recognition, sign language interpretation, and virtual reality interactions, enhancing human-computer interaction in diverse domains. Overall, hand landmark detection in Python empowers developers to create innovative and interactive applications leveraging the spatial information of hand gestures.
